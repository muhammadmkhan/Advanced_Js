// *** Left Shit Principle *** //

// The principle of Shift Left is to take a task that's traditionally done at a later stage of the process and perform that task at earlier stages.
//  ... Shift Left Testing addresses this by involving testing teams early in the process. 
//  Issues, be it in design or code, can be solved early on before they become major.
